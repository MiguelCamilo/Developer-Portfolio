							As a software engineer with experience in both front-end and
							back-end technologies, I am constantly seeking opportunities to
							expand my technical skills and knowledge. <br /> <br /> In my
							previous internship with Emergency Ventures, I improved the web
							app's responsiveness using responsive utility variants and built
							adaptive user interfaces for multiple platforms. I have also
							participated in a hackathon, where I developed a citizen
							non-emergency reporting app using React Native, React, and
							Node.js, and integrated API's using Fetch and ArcGIS. <br />{" "}
							<br /> In my current role as a Technical Expert at Apple, I use my
							diagnostics and people skills to ensure customers receive swift
							resolution to their technical issues. I am constantly keeping up
							with technical updates and changes across multiple Apple products,
							and enjoy mentoring my peers on technical and customer service
							issues.
							<br /> <br />
							In addition to my professional experience, I have completed
							coursework in programming logic in C at Palm Beach State College,
							and have completed a Full Stack Web Development Online Course
							through Udemy.
							<br /> <br />
							I am open to remote work and am excited to take on
							new challenges and opportunities in the field of software
							engineering.
